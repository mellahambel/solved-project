depreciation_formula

where P is the purchase price, S is the salvage value, and Y is the number of years the item is used.

A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda pop causes death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, and the desired weight of the dieter. Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a named constant for this fraction.

Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your program’s inputs should be:

The cost of a new car

The estimated miles driven per year

The estimated gas price

The efficiency in miles per gallon

The estimated resale value after 5 years

Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years. (For simplicity, we will not take the cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid and a comparable car from the Web, and use today’s gas price and 15,000 miles driven per year.
